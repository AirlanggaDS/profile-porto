        <div class="summary">I'm passionate about the IT field, especially in web development and business intelligence.
            My strengths lie in problem-solving, system assessment, and effective system evaluation. I have extensive
            experience using Python, MySQL, and Node.js programming languages, as well as Laravel and Django frameworks,
            in various projects including web development and mobile app development using Flutter. Additionally, I have
            experience in graphic design, which I typically use for committee work and UI/UX design. I have also worked
            on data analysis, visualization, and machine learning modeling, and I'm proficient in analytical tools like
            Tableau. Currently, I'm learning about cloud computing as part of the Bangkit 2024 program.</div>
